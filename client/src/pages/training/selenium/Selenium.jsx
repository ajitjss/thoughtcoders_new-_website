          <p>
            Selenium with Core Java is a powerful combination used for automating web application testing. 
            Selenium is an open-source tool that automates browsers, enabling testers to simulate user 
            interactions like clicking, typing, and navigating through a web page. When integrated with Java, 
            Selenium offers a robust, object-oriented programming environment that provides extensive libraries 
            and frameworks for managing test cases efficiently. Testers can use Selenium WebDriver, along with 
            Java concepts like loops, conditions, and OOP principles, to write effective and scalable automation 
            scripts. This setup is ideal for functional, regression, and cross-browser testing in complex web 
            applications.
