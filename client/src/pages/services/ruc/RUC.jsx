          Due to growing Electric Vehicles (EVs), Government Fuel Tax Collection is continuously declining and buy 
          Government needs funds to maintain roads, flyover and highways. So slowly each National wants to replace 
          fuel taxes with RUC (Road Usages Charge) Application. Road usages charging (RUC), also known as Vehicle 
          Miles Travelled(VMT) fees or sometimes referred to as Mileage Based User Fees(MBUF) is the process where 
          drivers need to pay for use of the roadway network based on distance travelled.

        RUC is the system that charges Vehicle owner based on Road Usages. This approach brings more transparency in 
        road taxes. Also, this helps the Government to collect genuine taxes and which can be utilized in 
        infrastructure and road maintenance. RUC is very similar to tolling and it’s direct user fee which is 
        collected from user as charges for Road utilities.

          Right, Accurate and Robust RUC Application is extremely important for Government as well as Driver and we 
          understand it well. So, we perform real testing and utilize our driver team to test RUC Applications. 
          Real tests give accurate data from ODOMETER and calculated from GPS. By analyzing this data developer 
          team can optimize applications so that RUC usages can be accurate and reduce errors.

          <strong>A.	Test Design on supporting Odometers: </strong>
          On general, RUC charges calculated from Odometer readings. An odometer is a device which is used to capture 
          distance travelled by vehicle. Odometers are usually two types one is analog, and another is digital odometer. As due to growing Digitalization, most of Odometers have capability to integrate with Internet. On the other hand, by using GPS (Global Positioning System) technology, we can track the mileage by Mobile Applications as well. 
          So, our testing team designed tests on the odometers and way to mileage capture technique. We ensure that RUC 
          application captures accurate mileage. We cover all the use cases and ensure 100% test coverage so no defect 
          or issues should propagate to Production.
